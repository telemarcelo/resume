Instead of using keyframes through css I wanted something lighter and simpler. I have seemed to have found a solution involving the use of a few lines of jquery & css.

The Javascript:

<script>
$(function(){
$("body").animate({backgroundPositionX : "-450"}, 25000);
});
</script>
The CSS:

<style type="text/css">
  body {
    background-image: url('../imgs/bg-image.jpg');
    background-repeat:repeat-x;
    }
</style>
